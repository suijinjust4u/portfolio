        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm an engineering student at SRM University with a passion for web development.</p>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Sujin, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. With a background in engineering and a strong foundation in programming, I thrive on transforming ideas into functional, visually appealing websites.

            My Journey
            I began my journey into the world of technology during my studies at SRM University, where I developed a keen interest in web development. Through various projects, I learned to harness the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic websites that not only meet the needs of users but also showcase my creative flair.
            
            Skills
            I possess a diverse skill set that includes:
            
            Front-End Development: Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I build responsive and interactive user interfaces.
            Back-End Development: Familiar with server-side technologies, enabling me to create robust applications.
            UI/UX Design: I understand the importance of user experience and strive to create intuitive interfaces.
            Version Control: I utilize Git for efficient collaboration and project management.
            Projects
            I have worked on several exciting projects, including a Telegram bot for interactive quizzes and a tic-tac-toe game with AI capabilities. Each project has enhanced my skills and taught me the importance of problem-solving and creativity in tech.
            
            My Philosophy
            I believe that technology should empower people and enhance their lives. My goal is to create web applications that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. I continuously seek to learn and adapt, keeping up with the latest trends and best practices in web development.
